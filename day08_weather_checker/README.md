* **API (Application Programming Interface):** A way to access data from another service
* **HTTP request:** Python sends a request, gets a response
* **JSON:** Common format returned by APIs

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json"
params = {
    "key": "your_api_key",
    "q": "Lagos"
}
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
data = response.json()

print(data["current"]["temp_c"])
```
